### Neutral jumping ###

If you slow down your character to a very low speed and press 'jump' without holding 'left' or 'right' you're going to do what's called a neutral jump. Neutral jump is like any other air jump, except that it sets your horizontal speed to exactly 0.

It's used mainly for optimizations by high level players, but even newer can use it to set up drops like in the clip below.
